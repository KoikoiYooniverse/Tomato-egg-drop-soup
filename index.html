<p style=" float:right";>1. This recipe uses hen eggs, but quail eggs are a good choice too. Reduce the steeping time as they are much smaller.
2. I have found that black tea produces the strongest stains. But other types of tea, eg. green tea, oolong tea, pu-erh tea, etc, are suitable as well.
3. You can use 1 teaspoon of five-spice powder to replace star anise, Chinese cinnamon, bay leaf and Sichuan pepper.
4. Be aware that the eggs might become too salty if left in the marinade for too long. After being removed from the marinade, they can be stored in the fridge for 4 days.”

<p style="float: right"; >2. Bring plenty of water (enough to cover all the eggs) to a full boil in a pot/saucepan. Gently slide in all the eggs. Leave to boil uncovered over medium heat for 8 minutes (if you prefer runny yolks, reduce the time to 7 minutes).
While waiting for the egg to cook, put all the other ingredients into a clean saucepan. Add 2 cups (500ml) of water. Bring to a boil then leave to simmer for 3 minutes. Set aside.
When the eggs are cooked, transfer them to a large bowl of cold water. Once they’re cool enough to touch, gently crack them one by one against the kitchen counter making sure the shells are cracked all around.
Place the eggs in a container (ideally one that can fit them snuggly). Pour in the marinade. Cover with a lid and leave to steep for 12 to 24 hours before serving (see note 4).
To reuse the leftover marinade: Freeze it if you don’t plan to make another batch soon. Add more tea, spices and seasonings when necessary. Always boil it for each use to prevent bacteria growth.
